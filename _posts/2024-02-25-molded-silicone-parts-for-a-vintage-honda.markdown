## Background

I own several motorcycles, and in my pursuit of novelty I usually buy and sell bikes fairly regularly. Most bikes stick around for 1-3 seasons on average. However, one bike I can never bring myself to sell. It is the first motorcycle I ever bought (back in 2014) a 1976 Honda CJ360T I've named Josie.

As reliable as these old hondas are they are still 50 year old bikes and tend to require a fair bit of maintenance and tinkering, but that is half the fun. This post is my experience using tools in my home office to remake an out of production rubber part for my bike.

### The Part

On each side of the CJ is an airbox that holds the air filter and feeds air into the carbs. They are held onto the bike with 3 bolts (Part #20). To keep vibrations down there is a rubber bushing that isolated the airbox from the frame (part #16). Finally there is a metal washer/collar piece that is the interface between the bolt and the bushing. Refer to the part diagram below for a visual representation.

The rubber bushings on my motorcycle are all either missing or in various states of disintegration. The Honda part number of the bushing is `31403-323-000` and while it is no longer manufactured, some suppliers do have new-old-stock examples available.

They seem to go for ~$4 each with shipping on top of that. I need six of them which would come to $24 plus shipping (~$8 when I looked). It got me thinking about trying to produce these parts myself. These are not the only degrading rubber parts on a bike like this and some of those parts aren't available at all. So a success here would allow me to make quite a few parts for this bike.

### The Plan

My plan was to use 2 part silicone and cast it in a 3d printed mold. This type of silicone is most often used for making molds however a recent [video on the FormLabs youtube channel](https://youtu.be/xDoUztSoyvk) got me thinking about using it with a 3d printed mold to produce a final part. I ordered a cheap kit on Amazon with seemingly decent reviews, and got to work on 3d modeling while I waited for it to arrive.

### Design

I went to Fusion 360 and I started by modeling the bushing itself. From there I modeled a cube over the part and subtracted out the bushing from the middle. This left me with a solid cube with a negative space in the middle in the shape of the part I wanted it. Finally I spilt this cube into 3 parts, one cylinder for the middle and two halves that hold the cylinder in place. The two halves got a set of four holes so they could be bolted together with m3 hardware. Finally for each half I added a hole into the molding chamber, one for silicone to be injected and the other for air to escape. To that end I placed one on the bottom and one on the top.

My plan was to use a large syringe to inject the silicone into the mold. I sourced a kit off amazon that had large syringes and a length of tubing. I sized the holes on the outside of the mold to accept the tubing.

### Casting

When my silicone came in I jumped right into trying my mold out. After filling the mold I needed to set it up for its overnight cure, however I quickly realize I needed someway to seal off the fill hole of the mold. I ended up wrapping the whole mold in strips of duct tape to try and seal off both holes, but the duct tape did not stick well to the silicone covered mold and the seal was anything but liquid tight. Additionally, while the 2 part silicone claims a 6 hour cure time I found that it was still very liquidy even after 6 hours (based on the leftovers in the mixing cup). Looking at reviews for the product this seems to be a common complaint. Thankfully since this is platinum-cure silicone the cure can be sped up with heat. I put the mold and mixing cup of leftovers in a warm spot and by the next morning they were set up.

### Results

Finally it was time to de-mold the parts and the results were less than ideal. However that was to be expected for a first shot, and the lessons I learned allowed me to quickly iterate my next attempt.

As you can see a large amount of air ended up being trapped in the mold and about 1/3 of the part was just missing. I think this was partly because of a poor seal from my hurried duct tape covering of the fill port also let some silicone seep out and air to take its place. But I believe another factor was bubbles in the silicone mix that rose to the surface becoming one large air pocket. I do not have access to a vacuum chamber which is the proper way to deal with bubbles in the mix. However the mix I am using advertises its ability to degas itself after pouring. This is likely due to its relatively low viscosity and long cure time.

### Design

Armed with the lessons learned from my first mold design and my first casting experience I set out to try again. This time I decided to make the mold with and open top. This would allow bubbles in the mix to rise to the surface without getting trapped. 

The new design started out just as before with a cube that had the model of the busing itself subtracted from the middle. Next I cut out the top of the mold with a circle just barely wider than the bushing itself (this was to create a lip I could use to gauge the height during the pour). Next I split the cube with very shallow cone shape. Then I split this top in half lengthwise and added bolt holes. This gave me 3 pieces, a bottom with the pug for the central hole and two top halves that could be pulled away from the side to model the undercut of the bushing shape.

Finally I decided to try for 2 parts in one go this time since the smallest batch of mix you can feasibly make is quite a bit more than what is needed for a single bushing, and any leftovers are effectively just a waste. To do that I just copied all three pieces, shifted the copies over and combined them to the original bodies.

### Casting

This time casting went much smoother. Armed with the knowledge of the long cure time of my silicone I let the mix sit for about 30 minutes after mixing so that most of the bubbles could dissipate before I tried pouring it. I then poured the mix into the mold, I was concerned with air getting trapped under the the shelf of the top pieces so I tried to pour slowly, filling the bottom completely before letting the top get any mix. The seal between the mold pieces isn't perfect but the mix is viscous enough to not leak out. Finally, I put the poured molds on to my 3d printer's build plate with the heat set to 45Â°C with a  cardboard box over them. 

### Results

After the pieces were fully cured I was able to remove them from the mold without too much difficulty and the results were much better. Below is two pieces after I trimmed the flashing off of them.

As you can see there are still quite a few bubbles in the part, however they still seem solid enough to be usable. For my next attempt I will probably let the mix sit even longer before pouring it and see if that helps.

## Wrap Up

I have yet to try these parts on my bike. I need to cast 4 more and then I will try them out. I have some concerns about their durability as they quite a bit softer than I imagine the OEM parts are but only time will tell. Either way I am quite impressed with how easy this process is and already have at least one other part I want to try remaking. I am also planning on looking into pigments for 2 part silicone so I can make the parts black and get a more OEM look. I will try to post an update on how these parts work in the field and any other parts I end up making with the same process.
